This zip file contains CDA Content Evaluation sample vendor documents which have
been "curated to some extent" at the Connectathon and saved for later download
by a monitor. Only documents which you had selected in the web application list 
at the time you clicked on the "Download selected document(s)" command button 
are included.

The documents you selected are stored in the zip file with file names of the
form doc#.xml, where # is a number assigned to differentiate the document files.

In addition to these xml files, there is a file named documentList.txt. This
contains one line for each downloaded document. The line contains, in tab
delimited format, the gazelle organization code and system code of the 
organization which generated the document, the document type, and the file name
of that document in the zip file.
